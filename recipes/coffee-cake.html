    <h1>Babby's Special Coffee Cake</h1>
    <img src="../images/coffee-cake.avif" alt="coffee cake on a plate on top of a blue table cloth">
    <p>This coffee cake is miraculously good.</p>
    <p>My wife makes this coffee cake for me every year on my birthday and it is my favorite part about going around the sun one more time. In the past I've helped chop pecans and cream the butter because it is a lot of work for one person.</p>

    <p>It's such a hit that even my little brother in law has started asking for a coffee cake on his birthday instead of a traditional cake. I always knew he was a good kid.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>For the Cake:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 stick butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 cups (scant) sugar</li>
        <li>3 cups flour, sifted</li>
        <li>4 tsp. baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>3 whole egg whites, beaten until stiff</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the Topping:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 stick butter, softened</li>
        <li>3/4 cup flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups pecans, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees</li>
        <li>Sift together flour, baking powder and salt</li>
        <li>Beat egg whites and set aside</li>
        <li>Cream butter and sugar</li>
        <li>Add flour mixture and milk alternatively until combined</li>
        <li>Don't overbeat</li>
        <li>Fold in beaten egg whites with a rubber spatula</li>
        <li>Spread in a well-greased 9 x 13 (or larger!) baking pan. A cake pan with higher sides is best</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine topping ingredients with a pastry cutter until crumbly</li>
        <li>Sprinkle all over the top.</li>
        <li>Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until no longer jiggly</li>
        <li>Serve warm</li>
    </ul>
